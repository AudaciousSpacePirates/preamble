# We the undersigned wish to parlay.  
All are welcome.  
Come in peace and let us re-establish healthy communication.  

Parlay is a temporary peace to discuss how to fix communication breakdowns and cease hostilities, with a committment to establishing lasting peace and cooperation between individuals and groups.


We will extend (and expect to be extended) a committment to the following basic communication minimums:  
* Facts matter.  
  * Learn to use [snopes.com](https://snopes.com).  
  * Learn about common [logical fallicies](https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/) and intentionally avoid them, especially [the fallacy fallacy](https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/the-fallacy-fallacy).  
* Challenges to fact will be decided on the spot, internet connectivity permitting.  
  * Anyone may ask for a fact check.  
  * Discussion of that topic pauses while facts are checked.  
  * Other non-blocked discussions can continue as normal, unless a full pause is requested.  
* Threats or threatening actions will result in a warning, and then expulsion.  
  * It's not a joke. Violence, violating consent, and harm to yourself or others are off limits for humor or action at parlay.  
  * If you can't restrain yourself for the duration of the parlay, bring us someone who can.  
* Language will be kept civil and generally profanity free.  
  * Curse like a pirate elsewhere.  
  * To the best of your ability, be specific, concise, and polite while communicating at parlay.  
* Personal attacks are not permitted.  
  * Claiming that it's a personal attack doesn't make it so.  
  * If the other person is being politely critical of faulty logic or unsound assumptions, they're doing you a favour.  
* Listen to others.  
  * Ensure all voices are heard by all.  
  * Call out the table for talking over others.
